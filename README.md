    bf_substitute_decoder.py: This file contains a brute-force decoder for a substitution cipher. It is designed by looking at the frequencies of letters and maps the letter with a certain frequency in the text to the letter with the same frequency in the englis language

    manual_decryptor.py: This file provides a manual decryption process for a specific encryption technique. It can be used to finish the decryption after using the brute-force method.

    encryption_functions.py: This file contains a collection of functions related to text encryption and decryption. It provides reusable functions for tasks such as letter substitution, frequency analysis, random mapping generation, and file manipulation.

    substitution_cipher_decoder.py: This file contains a decoder specifically designed for a substitution cipher, given the encryptopn key it decodes the encrypted file. 

    substitution_cipher.py: This file implements a substitution cipher encryption technique. It maps letters to other random letters. 

    vigenere_cipher.py implements the vigenere cipher https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher.
